Welcome to the Fire fly airlines website !
Using our website, the user will be able to sign-up for an account, login to his account and be able to
search for flights, make reservations, edit his bookings, view and edit his profile and also getting
exposed to our recommended places to visit.
We have two types of users, Admin and Consumer. An admin will be able to view and edit all flights in
the database, create new flights and also delete any of the flights. Admins will also be able to search for
flights according to criteria’s like departure airport, arrival airport, departure date and arrival date.
Each booking will be consisted of 2 flights (Departure flight and return flight), the seats reserved for the
departure flight and the seats reserved for the return flight as well. Moreover, each booking will have
it’s own unique ID.
Each consumer will be able to search for flights according to criteria’s : departure airport, arrival airport,
departure date, number of adults, number of children and cabin type. Consumer will be able to view the
results of his search, select one of the flights that appears in the search results, view all of its details,
select it and then be able to view all the possible return flights according to the chosen departure flight
and the user’s search criteria’s. After the user has chosen both flights, he will be able to choose his seats
for both departure and return flights. User will be able to view his profile, view his bookings, cancel
them, edit them, change his info and also change his password. Whenever a user creates an account, his
password is encrypted and stored in the database (hashed) alongside with the other user’s info.
Once a user signs up, he will be prompted to sign in and once he does he will be redirected the User’s
portal home page where he will be able to find different useful buttons to help him navigate through
our website (like search for a flight, user’s profile, already made bookings etc...). The user will also find
some really useful information about some places that we recommend visiting like Cairo, Paris,
Amsterdam, London, Barcelona, etc...
We have worked on the project’s requirements at first then we starting working on enhancing the UI
and UX As much as we can, but unfortunately one of our team mates has decided to drop the course
(after we have divided the tasks), so the work load suddenly doubled right before the deadline of the
most important sprint. We also had to do some really important functionalities of sprint 2 that he also
decided not to do right before the deadline. That’s mainly the reason why our final product is mot
perfect and had to be rushed .
